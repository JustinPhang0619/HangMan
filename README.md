# HangMan
Created using Scala, JavaFX and ScalaFX. A standard HangMan game where users are able to add their custom words. A database is implemented to check for high scores.


Users can choose to upload their own words, which allows them to customize the word database. These words are then randomized and picked for each game of HangMan.
